High-functioning autistic children tend to have poor verbal and nonverbal communication skills that make it hard for them to understand peopleâ€™s cues and blend in with their community. In this project, I worked on an integrated solution to this problem that helps Arabic-speaking people with autism to communicate effectively and understand the feelings of others, through an AI-based Communication Tool with a mobile camera to take a picture of the person who speaks with the autistic person, and then inform the autistic individual of the feelings of the other through the mobile application. To ensure continuous improvement in communication skills, I worked on providing a pseudo social script feature to encourage the autistic to initiate a conversation by giving him appropriate responses depending on facial emotion recognition. To achieve this, I used images from the Aff- Wild2 and FERPlus datasets in CNN deep learning model for processing data to train the emotion recognition algorithm and subsequently increase its effectiveness in actual use, achieving 83.97% accuracy. On the other hand to complete the picture unity in application development was uesd to provide games that help the autistic to practice all the time on social scenarios.
