abstract: High-functioning autistic children tend to have poor verbal and nonverbal communication skills, which makes it hard for them to understand people’s cues and blend in with their community.This paper presents a solution to help Arabicspeaking children with autism communicate effectively and understand others’ feelings. Our AI-based Communication Tool uses a mobile camera to capture the speaker’s image and informs the autistic child of their emotions through a mobile app. We used images from the FER+ dataset to train on several TensorFlow models to achieve accurate facial recognition. We achieved 83.97% accuracy. Furthermore, we develop games on the mobile application using Unity to help autistic children practice different social scenarios.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A tool can be used by autistic individuals to ease their social communication, through which deep learning and game development are used.
